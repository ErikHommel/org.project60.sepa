## How to add a SEPA Mandate
The first step to create a SEPA Mandate depends on the version of CiviSEPA you are using.

### CiviSEPA version 1.2.5 and earlier
In this version you will find the SEPA Mandates for a contact in the *Contact Summary** under the **Contributions** tab as you can see here: ![Screenshot](img/sepa-mandate-contributions-tab.png)

To add a new SEPA Mandate in this form you click the *Record SEPA Contribution** button.

In later versions SEPA Mandates have their own tab in the **Contact Summary** as you can see here: ![Screenshot](img/sepa-mandate-tab.png)
